Implements Bitcoin send/receive functionality per the spec for crypto currency plugins for [edge-core-js](https://github.com/EdgeApp/edge-core-js)

## Installing

    npm i edge-currency-accountbased -s

```
import { stellarCurrencyPluginFactory } from `edge-currency-accountbased`
import { rippleCurrencyPluginFactory } from `edge-currency-accountbased`
```

Now you can pass plugins to `edge-core-js`.

```
const plugins = [
    stellarCurrencyPluginFactory,
    rippleCurrencyPluginFactory
]
const context = makeEdgeContext({
  apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  plugins
})
```

## Contributing

You'll need to install Yarn 1.3.2 globally on your machine

To run a local version of this repo inside the full Edge Wallet app, clone this repo at the same level as `edge-react-gui`

    git clone git@github.com:EdgeApp/edge-currency-accountbased.git`
    cd edge-currency-accountbased
    yarn

Run `npm run test` to run the unit tests.

To use the local cloned version of this repo, `cd edge-react-gui` and run

    npm run updot edge-currency-accountbased
    npm run prepare

This will copy the necessary files from `edge-currency-accountbased` into the `edge-react-gui/node_modules/edge-currency-accountbased` replacing the npm installed version. This needs to be done after any modifications to `edge-currency-accountbased`
