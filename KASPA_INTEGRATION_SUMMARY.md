# Kaspa EdgeCurrencyPlugin Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated Kaspa (KAS) as a new EdgeCurrencyPlugin for the edge-currency-accountbased project. The implementation follows the established patterns used by other cryptocurrency plugins in the codebase.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/kaspa/kaspaTypes.ts`
- Defines TypeScript interfaces and type validators for Kaspa-specific data structures
- Includes `KaspaNetworkInfo`, `KaspaWalletOtherData`, `KaspaPrivateKeys`
- Defines the `KaspaInfoPayload` for info server communication
- Uses the `cleaners` library for runtime type validation

### 2. `src/kaspa/kaspaInfo.ts`
- Main plugin configuration file that exports the Kaspa currency plugin
- Defines network information (Kaspa servers, explorers)
- Configures currency metadata:
  - Currency code: `KAS`
  - Display name: `Kaspa`
  - Plugin ID: `kaspa`
  - Wallet type: `wallet:kaspa`
  - Denominations: 1 KAS = 100,000,000 sompis (base units)
- Uses `makeOuterPlugin` to create the plugin factory
- Lazy-loads the heavy crypto implementations via dynamic imports

### 3. `src/kaspa/KaspaTools.ts`
- Implements the `EdgeCurrencyTools` interface for Kaspa
- Provides essential wallet operations:
  - Private key generation and import from BIP39 mnemonic
  - Public key derivation from private keys
  - Address validation (basic regex pattern for `kaspa:` prefix)
  - URI parsing and encoding for payment requests
- Uses standard cryptographic libraries (bip39, rfc4648)
- Includes placeholder address generation (production implementation would use actual Kaspa SDK)

### 4. `src/kaspa/KaspaEngine.ts`
- Implements the currency engine factory function
- Uses the common `CurrencyEngine` base class
- Follows the same pattern as other currency plugins like Binance

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/index.ts`
- Added import for the Kaspa plugin: `import { kaspa } from './kaspa/kaspaInfo'`
- Registered the `kaspa` plugin in the main plugins object
- The plugin is now available to the Edge app framework

### 2. `package.json`
- Added `@kaspa/wallet: "^1.4.27"` as a dependency
- This provides access to the official Kaspa JavaScript SDK for future enhancements

## Technical Implementation Details

### Plugin Architecture
The implementation follows the Edge plugin architecture with:
- **Outer Plugin**: Lightweight wrapper with metadata and lazy loading
- **Inner Plugin**: Heavy crypto operations loaded on-demand
- **Tools**: Core wallet operations (key management, address validation, URI handling)
- **Engine**: Transaction and balance management using common base classes

### Network Configuration
- **Mainnet servers**: DNS seed nodes for Kaspa network connectivity
- **Explorer servers**: Block explorers for address/transaction lookups
- **Address format**: Uses `kaspa:` prefix followed by hex identifier
- **Denominations**: 1 KAS = 100,000,000 sompis (following Bitcoin-style precision)

### Security Features
- BIP39 mnemonic support for seed phrase generation
- Deterministic address derivation from private keys
- Input validation for addresses and amounts
- Uses established cryptographic libraries

## Future Enhancements

### Production Readiness
To make this production-ready, the following enhancements would be needed:

1. **Real Address Derivation**: Replace placeholder address generation with actual Kaspa address derivation using the `@kaspa/wallet` library
2. **Network Integration**: Implement actual network communication with Kaspa nodes
3. **Transaction Building**: Add transaction creation and signing capabilities
4. **Balance Queries**: Implement UTXO tracking and balance calculation
5. **Block Explorer Integration**: Connect to real Kaspa block explorers
6. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests

### Kaspa-Specific Features
- UTXO management (Kaspa is UTXO-based like Bitcoin)
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) transaction handling
- High-throughput transaction processing
- Real-time balance updates

## Integration Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Plugin structure and registration
- Basic wallet operations
- URI encoding/decoding
- Type definitions
- Dependency management

ðŸš§ **Requires Production Implementation**:
- Actual Kaspa SDK integration
- Network communication
- Transaction handling
- Balance synchronization

The foundation is complete and ready for integration with the official Kaspa JavaScript SDK to provide full functionality.
